# PART 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

## 1.1 Tagline
> **Become the richest and most famous landlord dynasty in Lima—while the city, the press, and Public Mood try to take you down.**

## 1.2 Design Goals

| Goal | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| **Fast to learn (≤60s)** | Each round: one Bid + one Action |
| **High virality** | Public rooms, Watchers influence outcomes, shareable Portada + Logros |
| **Low infra + low hardware** | Turn-based, 2D UI-first, Godot Web export, authoritative server |
| **Tycoon feel without complexity** | Demand cycles + portfolio overhead + upgrades |
| **Strong Lima/Peru flavor** | Spanish-only player content, last-10-years macro themes |

## 1.3 Language Rules (Hard)
- All **player-facing UI, cards, headlines, and prompts**: Spanish
- All **logic variables and code comments**: English
- Spanish strings loaded from `data/locales_es.json`

## 1.4 Hard Constraints (Must Not Change)

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Max Owners | 12 (Standard mode) |
| Max Participants | 20 (Owners + Watchers) |
| Watchers | Unlimited within room cap |
| Events | Targeted at single Owner (probability scales with properties/wealth/fame) |
| Insurance | Has cost AND benefit |
| Catch-up mechanics | Mandatory |
| Deals | Template-only: 7 types, no free-form |
| Graf Design System | Admin UI only |
| Public rooms | Viewable; profile shares unlisted by default |
| Currency | Graf Dollar (GD) — prestige leaderboard currency; no in-match advantage from persistent wallet |
| Match fairness | All players start with identical GD per mode; persistent wallet has zero in-match effect |

## 1.5 Open Source Foundation Strategy

This project leverages proven open-source foundations to minimize development risk and maximize code quality. See **Appendix O** for the complete evaluation matrix.

**Primary Stack:**
- **Server**: Colyseus (authoritative state, rooms, WebSocket)
- **Client**: Godot 4.x with optional GodotJS for TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis (optional, for rate limiting)

| PUBLIC | Open join | Yes (lobby) | PARODY |
| FRIENDS | Token/QR | No | REAL_LABEL |

**Host Controls:**
- Lock seats after Round 1
- Override team set (with disclaimer acceptance for REAL_LABEL in public)
- Enable/disable "Unique Teams" (each team used by only one Owner)

## 2.3 Starting Values by Mode

All players in a match start with identical resources — no persistent-wallet influence.

| Resource | Quick | Standard | Long |
|----------|-------|----------|------|
| Cash | GD 500,000 | GD 650,000 | GD 800,000 |
| Debt | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Fame | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Compliance | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Political Exposure | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Debt Cap | GD 750,000 | GD 750,000 | GD 750,000 |

**What 500K buys in Quick:** 2 entry properties (200K+250K=450K, GD 50K left) OR 1 mid-range (500K, GD 0 left). Players must choose between breadth (multiple cheap) or concentration (one strong asset).

**Game arc:** R1-R2 buy entry-level (200-400K). R3-R5 accumulate rent, bid on mid/upper tier. R6-R7 premium properties are aspirational targets requiring loans + accumulated wealth.

### 3.5.8 Streamer Mode (NEW in v12.1)

Toggle in player settings. When active:

| Element | Normal Mode | Streamer Mode |

| Player names | Custom names | Custom names (unchanged) |
| UI layout | Standard | Stream-overlay-friendly (wider margins, higher contrast) |

**Stream delay:** When enabled, all state updates are buffered client-side for the configured delay before rendering. Prevents stream-sniping in competitive matches.

### 3.5.9 Clip Export (NEW in v12.1)

One-tap clip generation from key match moments:

**Clip-worthy triggers** (server marks these in match timeline):
- Auction win (especially last-second steals)

- Wealth overtake (#1 position change)
- League promotion (end-of-match)
- Package creation

**Clip spec:**
- Duration: 10-15 seconds centered on trigger moment
- Format: MP4 (H.264) for direct share, GIF fallback for low-bandwidth
- Resolution: 720p (mobile-optimized)
- Overlay: Player name + dynasty + "IMPERIO INMOBILIARIO" watermark + deep link
- Export: One-tap share to WhatsApp, Instagram Stories, TikTok, Copy Link

**Implementation:** Client records a rolling 30s replay buffer. When a clip-worthy moment occurs, a "Compartir clip" button appears for 5s. Tap generates the clip from the buffer.

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Clip markers only (manual screenshot encouraged). Share card with moment description.
**Phase 2:** Full video clip export.

### 3.5.10 Anonymous Spectating (NEW in v12.1)

Public matches can be spectated without an account:

```
1. Non-player visits imperio.game/watch/{roomId} or browses public matches
2. Enters as anonymous Watcher (no Mood vote, no Rumor, no betting)
3. Can view full match state + Quick Chat + events
4. After match ends: CTA "Crea tu cuenta para jugar" (one-tap signup)
5. If signup: receives GD 10,000 welcome bonus + redirect to tutorial
```

**Watcher Progression** (for registered Watchers):
- +1 Watcher XP per correct auction bet prediction
- +2 Watcher XP per match watched to completion
- Thresholds: 10 XP = "Observador" badge, 50 XP = "Analista" badge, 100 XP = "Experto" badge
- Badges visible on profile when player becomes an Owner

# PART 4: ONBOARDING & TIME-TO-FUN

## 4.1 Design Principles (Viral Best Practices 2025-2026)

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Interactive tutorials, not text walls | Coach overlays with ≤2 Spanish sentences |
| Core gameplay within 60 seconds | Tutorial forces first auction participation |
| Milestone-based feature unlocking | Achievements gate advanced features |
| First-win guarantee | Bot heuristics ensure user wins R1 auction |

## 4.2 Mandatory First-Time Tutorial Match

**Trigger**: First time an account joins any room

**Format:**
```yaml
rounds: 2
owners: 3 minimum (fill with Bots)
setup: 1 Human vs 2-3 Bots
```

**Scripted Outcomes:**
- **Round 1**: User wins a cheap auction with suggested bid (Bot heuristics: bid GD 50,000)
- **Round 2**: User targeted by mild event; sees insurance mitigate it

**Constraints:**
- Coach overlays: max 2 Spanish sentences per phase
- Skippable after completing once

**Reward:**
- Achievement: `A-TUT-01 "Primer Casero"`
- Cosmetic badge

## 4.3 Bot Heuristics for Tutorial

See **Appendix A8** for complete bot logic. Key Tutorial behaviors:

| Round | Bot Behavior |
|-------|--------------|
| R1 | Always bid GD 50,000 (ensures human wins) |
| R2 | Do not mitigate event (shows insurance value) |

# PART 5: CORE LOOP & STATE MACHINE

## 5.1 Phase Sequence (Authoritative)

### 5.1.1 Normal Rounds (11 Phases)
```
REVEAL → BID → INCOME_CALC → VISUAL_LEDGER → ACTION → MOOD → DEALS → EVENTS → PRESS → [AWARDS] → SNAPSHOT
```

### 5.1.2 Election Rounds (VOTE replaces MOOD)
```
REVEAL → BID → INCOME_CALC → VISUAL_LEDGER → ACTION → VOTE → DEALS → EVENTS → PRESS → [AWARDS] → SNAPSHOT
```

## 5.3 Hard Ordering Rule (No Ambiguity)

1. Resolve bids (determine auction winners)
2. Apply Income (rent + signals + ops + debt + scheduled + leader tax)
3. **Visual Ledger animation** (client-side, server waits 4.0s)
4. Collect actions
5. Resolve Mood/Vote result (queued effects)
6. Resolve deals at DEALS phase (post-action ownership authoritative)
7. Select targets and resolve events (apply caps)
8. Generate headlines
9. Emit achievements
10. Emit snapshots

**Timeouts:**
- No bid → No bid submitted
- No action → Pass
- No mood/vote → No vote counted

Server proceeds regardless of client response.

## 5.4 REVEAL Phase

Server reveals:
- **Market Row**: Properties available for auction
- **Market Signals**: Two signals affecting rent by tag
- **Mood Options**: Two options (non-election rounds)
- **Special Round Rule**: If applicable

### 5.4.1 Round Seed Security (v10 Fix)

**Vulnerability Fixed**: Sending `matchSeed` at start allowed clients to predict all future coin flips.

**Solution**:
```
serverSecret = generateSecureRandom()  // Never sent to client
roundSeed = sha256(matchSeed + serverSecret + roundNumber)
```

**Constraint**: Server sends `roundSeed` ONLY in the REVEAL packet for that specific round.

## 5.5 BID Phase (Sealed, Simultaneous)

Each Owner may bid on **one** property:
- `(propertyId, amount)`
- Optional: spend 1 Fame as tie-break token (max 1 per round)

### 5.5.1 Payment Model (Winner-Only)
- Only winning Owner pays bid amount
- Losing Owners pay nothing (no escrow, no refunds)

### 5.5.2 Tie-Break Order
1. Higher bid amount
2. Fame token used (yes > no)
3. Higher current Fame
4. **Deterministic seeded coin flip**

### 5.5.3 Deterministic Coin Flip (Hash)
```typescript
function tieBreak(roundSeed: string, propertyId: string, tiedOwnerIds: string[]): string {
  const sorted = tiedOwnerIds.slice().sort();
  const input = `${roundSeed}|${propertyId}|${sorted.join(',')}`;
  const hash = sha256(input);
  const index = parseInt(hash.slice(0, 8), 16) % sorted.length;
  return sorted[index];
}
```

## 5.6 INCOME_CALC Phase (Server-Side, Instant)

Server calculates in order:
1. Rent income (with Market Signals) — GD amounts per property
2. Operating costs (portfolio overhead) — GD 8,000 per unit
3. Debt service
4. Leader friction tax ("Impuesto a la fama") — GD 8,000/15,000
5. Scheduled effects (loan repayments, etc.)
6. Forced sales if cash < 0

### 5.6.1 R1 Consolation Rule ("Subsidio de arranque")

If an Owner owns **0 properties** at end of R1 INCOME_CALC, grant **GD 50,000**.

- One-time, R1 only
- Headline: *"{OWNER} recibe subsidio municipal para arrancar."*
- Rationale: 50K = 10% of starting cash (500K Quick). Enough to cover insurance or development costs but not enough to close the gap on someone who bought a property.

## 5.7 VISUAL_LEDGER Phase (REVISED in v12.3)

**Purpose**: Visualize the "Invisible Accountant" calculations

**Duration**: Adaptive (base 3.0s + 0.15s per item, capped at 5.0s max)

**Formula**:
```
duration = min(3.0 + (numItems × 0.15), 5.0)
```

**Item Limit**: Maximum 12 line items displayed. If more items exist:
- Group minor items (< GD 5,000) into "Otros ingresos" / "Otros costos"
- Always show individual rent per property if ≤ 5 properties
- Properties 6+ collapse to "Rentas adicionales (×N): +GD X"

**Client Behavior**:
- Lock ACTION input buttons
- Display animated Income Receipt:
  ```
  ┌──────────────────────────────┐
  │  Rentas:    +GD 95,000  🟢   │
  │  Costos:    -GD 16,000  🔴   │
  │  ──────────────────────      │
  │  Total:     +GD 79,000       │
  │  [Cash counter animates]     │
  └──────────────────────────────┘
  ```

**Overflow Layout** (when > 12 items):
  ```
  ┌──────────────────────────────┐
  │  Rentas (×8): +GD 180,000 🟢 │
  │  Bonos:        +GD 14,000 🟢 │
  │  ──────────────────────      │
  │  Costos:      -GD 32,000 🔴  │
  │  ──────────────────────      │
  │  Total:      +GD 162,000     │
  └──────────────────────────────┘
  ```

**Constraint**: Players CANNOT click Action buttons until animation completes. Server-side timer is authoritative.

## 5.8 ACTION Phase (Major/Minor Split)

Choose **one Major action** plus **zero or one Minor action**:

### Major Actions (pick 1)

| Action | Cost | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Develop | GD 60,000-100,000 (meter-dependent) | +GD 12,000 rent permanently, +GD 40,000 worth |
| Package | GD 40,000 | Create "Paquete Inmobiliario" from 3+ owned properties (see 7.9) |
| Deal (offer) | 0 | Propose template deal |
| Pass | 0 | Do nothing |

### Minor Actions (pick 0 or 1)

| Action | Cost | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Insure | GD 20,000-60,000 | Add/upgrade insurance |
| Security Contract | GD 20,000 | Protection until end of next round |
| PR Push | 0 | +1 Fame, +0.5 RiskScore next round |
| Compliance Audit | 0 | +1 Compliance, -0.5 RiskScore next round |

### Special: Romper Pacto
- Cost: 0 (consumes both Major AND Minor slots)
- Effect: Cancel active pact (once per match)

This Major/Minor split doubles decision space without adding time: you can now Develop AND Insure, or Deal AND PR Push in the same round.

## 5.9 MOOD Phase (Non-Election Rounds)

### 5.9.1 Mood Option Generation

Server picks **2 mood options** per round from `data/moods.json` (8 total). Selection rules:
- One positive/beneficial, one negative/disruptive
- No repeats in consecutive rounds

### 5.9.2 Mood Options

| ID | Name | Effect |
|----|------|--------|
| M-01 | Boom de alquileres | All rent +GD 10,000 next round |
| M-02 | Miedo al mercado | All rent -GD 10,000 next round |
| M-03 | Fiebre inversora | Develop cost -GD 30,000 next round |
| M-04 | Vecinos molestos | All RiskScore +0.3 next round |
| M-05 | Calma chicha | Suppress 1 event next round |
| M-06 | Prensa hambrienta | Fame gains/losses ×2 next round |
| M-07 | Ojo fiscalizador | High-compliance owners (≥2) get +GD 20,000 bonus next round |
| M-08 | Gentrificacion express | Properties under GD 400,000 get +GD 12,000 rent next round |

### 5.9.3 Voting

**When Watchers present (≥1):** Watchers vote between 2 options (one tap, 15s timer).
- Winning modifier queued to apply next round
- Optional: show live percentages (host option)

**When 0 Watchers (Owner fallback):** Owners vote on mood options instead.
- Timer reduced to **10s**
- Same voting rules apply
- Each Owner gets one vote

### 5.9.4 Tie-Breaking

1. Higher vote count wins
2. If tied: positive-delta option wins (the one that benefits players)
3. If still tied: deterministic coin flip using `roundSeed`

### 5.9.5 MoodOption Schema

```typescript
interface MoodOption {
  id: string;           // "M-01"
  nombre_es: string;    // "Boom de alquileres"
  effect: {
    type: "RENT_ALL" | "DEVELOP_COST" | "RISK_ALL" | "SUPPRESS_EVENT" | "FAME_MULTIPLIER" | "COMPLIANCE_BONUS" | "RENT_TIER";
    delta?: number;
    multiplier?: number;
    threshold?: number;  // for RENT_TIER: basePrice threshold
    duration: number;    // rounds
  };
  sentiment: "POSITIVE" | "NEGATIVE" | "NEUTRAL";
}
```

## 5.10 VOTE Phase (Election Rounds)

**Owners choose:**
- Candidate A or B (or C in Standard/Long)
- Contribution: GD 0 / GD 25,000 / GD 50,000 (counts as "support points")

**Watchers vote:**
- Candidate A or B (one tap)

### 5.10.1 Election Winner Determination

```
ScoreA = Σ(ownerContributionToA)
ScoreB = Σ(ownerContributionToB)

if ScoreA != ScoreB:
    winner = higher score
elif watcherVoteA != watcherVoteB:
    winner = higher watcher vote
else:
    winner = deterministic coin flip
```

**Effects:**
- Winner bundle applies for **next 2 rounds** (meters + weight shifts)
- Any Owner contributing > GD 0 increases Political Exposure by +1 (max 3)

### 5.10.2 Quick Mode Mini-Election (R5)

Simplified election for Quick Mode:
- **2 candidates** (not 3) — server picks 2 from `data/elections.json`
- **Contribution:** GD 0 or GD 25,000 only (simplified tier)
- **Bundle duration:** 1 round (instead of 2)
- **Timer:** 15s
- This gives Quick Mode a political moment without the full weight of Standard/Long elections

## 5.11 DEALS Phase

Resolve accepted deals deterministically (see Appendix A2).

## 5.12 EVENTS Phase

Resolve targeted events and rare global events, applying fairness caps.

## 5.13 PRESS Phase

Generate 1-3 Spanish headlines in the match Press Persona style.

## 5.14 AWARDS Phase (Optional)

Server nominates Owners for:
- "Favorito del público"
- "Ampay del día"

Watchers vote (1 tap). Awards applied at end of match.

## 5.15 Special Rounds (Tempo Markers)

Mandatory "moment density" events:

| Mode | Round | Event |
|------|-------|-------|
| Quick | R3 | Guerra de Distrito |
| Quick | R5 | Mini-Eleccion |
| Quick | R6 | Ventana Bancaria |
| Standard | R3 | Guerra de Distrito |
| Standard | R5 | Ventana Bancaria |
| Standard | R9 | Subasta de Prestigio |
| Long | R4 | Guerra de Distrito |
| Long | R8 | Ventana Bancaria |
| Long | R13 | Subasta de Prestigio |

### 5.15.1 Special Round Effects

**Guerra de Distrito:**
- Market Row biased to one district
- Completing a set this round grants +1 Fame

**Mini-Eleccion (Quick R5):**
- 2 candidates, simplified contributions (GD 0 or GD 25,000)
- Bundle lasts 1 round only
- See 5.10.2

**Ventana Bancaria:**
- Loan improves: +GD 200,000 now (instead of +GD 150,000), repay total still Principal + GD 30,000 + (InterestRates × GD 15,000)
- Media/Scandal event weight +10%

**Subasta de Prestigio:**
- Auction win grants +2 Fame
- Watchers see "Portada preview"

# PART 6: ECONOMY & SCORING

## 6.1 Resources

| Resource | Range | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Cash | GD 0+ | Liquid money (Graf Dollar) |
| Debt | GD 0-750,000 | Owed money (cap GD 750,000) |
| Fame | 0+ | Media attention / reputation |
| Compliance | 0-3 | Regulatory standing |
| Political Exposure | 0-3 | Government attention |

## 6.2 Wealth Formula (Primary Win Condition)

```
Wealth = Cash + Σ(PropertyWorth) − Debt

PropertyWorth = BasePrice + (UpgradeLevel × 40,000) + WorthBonuses + PackageWorthBonus
```

**WorthBonuses** include:
- Infrastructure corridor bonus (+GD 100,000 while active)
- Temporary worth bonuses from events
- **PackageWorthBonus**: +GD 75,000 if property is in an active Package (see 7.9)

## 6.3 Rent Calculation

```
Rent = BaseRent
     + (UpgradeLevel × 12,000)
     + DistrictSetBonus
     + MarketSignalBonus
     + TemporaryRentBonus
     + PackageRentBonus
```

### 6.3.1 District Set Bonus
2+ properties in same district: **+GD 5,000 rent per property** in that district.

### 6.3.2 Market Signal Bonus
Each signal modifies rent by tag (±GD 3,000 per property per matching tag, per-property cap ±GD 3,000).

### 6.3.3 Package Rent Bonus
Properties in an active Package: **+GD 6,000 rent per property** in the package (see 7.9).

## 6.4 Market Signals (Tycoon Layer)

Each round reveals 2 signals. Signals defined in `data/signals.json`.

| ID | Name | Tag Effects (units) |
|----|------|---------------------|
| S-01 | Boom Airbnb | turismo +1, costa +1 |
| S-02 | Oficinas flojas | oficinas -1 |
| S-03 | Puerto full | logistica +1 |
| S-04 | Lima de noche | cultura +1 |
| S-05 | Familias compran | residencial +1 |
| S-06 | Burocracia al 200% | gobierno -1 |
| S-07 | Turismo asustado | turismo -1, costa -1 |
| S-08 | Rebote post-crisis | residencial +1, oficinas +1 |
| S-09 | Flete caro | logistica -1 |
| S-10 | Moda Barranco | cultura +1, turismo +1 |

**Rule**: No repeat of same signal in consecutive rounds.
**GD conversion**: Each signal unit = ±GD 3,000 per matching tag per property (server applies).

## 6.5 Operating Costs (Portfolio Overhead)

```
OpsCost = floor((NumProperties + TotalUpgrades) / 3) × 12,000
```

Properties in a Package count as `ceil(count/2)` toward NumProperties for OpsCost (efficiency bonus).

**Impact table:**

| Properties | Upgrades | Raw Count | OpsCost (GD) | Typical Rent | OpsCost % of Rent |
|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 30-50K | 0% |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 60-100K | 0% |
| 3 | 0 | 3 | 12,000 | 100-150K | 8-12% |
| 4 | 2 | 6 | 24,000 | 150-220K | 11-16% |
| 6 | 4 | 10 | 36,000 | 250-350K | 10-14% |
| 8 | 6 | 14 | 48,000 | 350-500K | 10-14% |
| 3 (pkg) | 0 | 2 | 0 | 120K+ | 0% (package benefit) |
| 5 (3 pkg+2) | 2 | 6 | 24,000 | 200-280K | 9-12% |

**Design rationale:** OpsCost should consume 10-15% of rent income at 4+ properties to create genuine friction for portfolio expansion. The previous formula (`/4 × 8K`) produced 3-5% friction — cosmetic, not strategic.

Applied during INCOME phase after rent collection, before leader friction tax.

## 6.6 Leader Friction ("Impuesto a la fama")

Applied during INCOME phase after OpsCost:

```
LeaderTax:
  Top Wealth quartile: 5% of TotalRentThisRound
  #1 Wealth (if Wealth > 1.2 × Wealth(#2)): 10% of TotalRentThisRound
```

| Scenario | Rent Income | Tax | Effective Rent |
|----------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| Top quartile, GD 150K rent | 150,000 | 7,500 | 142,500 |
| Top quartile, GD 300K rent | 300,000 | 15,000 | 285,000 |
| #1 runaway, GD 300K rent | 300,000 | 30,000 | 270,000 |
| #1 runaway, GD 500K rent | 500,000 | 50,000 | 450,000 |

**Design rationale:** Percentage-based tax scales with success. A flat GD 8-15K tax was 5-10% of early-game income but <3% of late-game income — invisible to leaders. The 5%/10% split creates genuine tension: getting rich is still rewarded, but the tax is felt in every INCOME calculation. Reference: Power Grid's turn-order reversal achieves similar friction at ~8-12% effective disadvantage.

**INCOME phase order:** Rent → Signals → OpsCost → Leader Tax → Debt repayment → Net cash change.

## 6.7 Forced Sales

If cash < 0 after Income:
1. Sell lowest-basePrice property at **80% BasePrice**
2. Repeat until cash ≥ 0 or no properties remain

## 6.8 Late-Game Cash Sinks (NEW in v12.1)

### 6.8.1 Multi-Level Development

Properties can be developed beyond level 2 (requires prior upgrade to each level):

| Level | Cost (GD) | Rent Bonus | Conditions |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| 1 | 60,000-100,000 | +12,000/round | Standard (existing) |
| 2 | 60,000-100,000 | +12,000/round | Standard (existing) |
| 3 | 150,000 | +15,000/round | Available from Round 5+ |
| 4 | 200,000 | +18,000/round | Available from Round 8+ |
| 5 | 300,000 | +20,000/round | Long Mode only (Round 10+) |

**Design rationale:** Levels 3-5 provide diminishing returns per GD invested (+10% rent/GD at level 3 vs +15-20% at levels 1-2) but give wealthy players a productive use for accumulated cash. Without these sinks, players accumulate GD 1-2M liquid cash with no meaningful use in rounds 8+.

### 6.8.2 Prestige Auction (Final Round Only)

In the final round's ACTION phase, an additional Major action is available:

**"Inversión de Prestigio"** — Bid any amount of cash. The bid is removed from your in-match Wealth but converts to a **1.5x multiplier** on the bid amount for persistent GD earnings.

```
Example: Player bids GD 500,000
  In-match: -GD 500,000 Wealth (affects final ranking)
  Persistent: +GD 750,000 additional persistent GD (on top of normal match earnings)
```

**Trade-off:** Spending cash hurts your in-match final Wealth ranking (and placement bonus) but earns more persistent GD. This creates a genuine dilemma: finish 1st in the match, or sacrifice rank for long-term leaderboard climbing?

**Limit:** Maximum bid = 50% of current cash (prevents all-in dumps that distort rankings).

---

# PART 7: ACTIONS & DEALS

## 7.1 Develop Action (Major — Wired to Construction Enforcement)

**Base cost**: GD 60,000

**Meter wiring**:
```
DevelopCost = 60,000 + floor((ConstructionEnforcement + 1) / 2) × 20,000
```

| Enforcement Level | Cost (GD) |
|-------------------|-----------|
| 0 | 60,000 |
| 1 | 80,000 |
| 2 | 80,000 |
| 3 | 100,000 |

**Effect**: +GD 12,000 rent permanently, +GD 40,000 to PropertyWorth. Adds +0.05 RiskScore next round.

## 7.2 Deal System (Template-Only, Server-Enforced)

### 7.2.1 Limits
- One outgoing offer per Owner per round
- One counter-offer maximum
- Offers expire at end of DEALS phase

### 7.2.2 Deal Templates (7 Types)

| ID | Template | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Cash for Property | Buy property for cash |
| 2 | Property Swap | Exchange properties |
| 3 | Bank Loan | Borrow from bank (see 7.2.3) |
| 4 | Election Pact | Support candidate for payment |
| 5 | Non-compete | No bid in district for payment |
| 6 | Security Escort | Protection for payment |
| 7 | Sell Package | Sell entire property package as one transaction (see 7.9) |

### 7.2.2b Deal Price Validation (NEW in v12.1)

Server validates all deals to prevent kingmaking via asset dumping:

| Template | Validation Rule |
|----------|----------------|
| Cash for Property (#1) | `amount >= BasePrice × 0.6 AND amount <= BasePrice × 2.0` |
| Property Swap (#2) | `abs(BasePrice_A - BasePrice_B) <= max(BasePrice_A, BasePrice_B) × 0.5` |
| Sell Package (#7) | `amount >= sum(BasePrice of properties in package) × 0.6` |
| Election Pact (#4) | `payment >= GD 20,000 AND payment <= GD 150,000` |
| Non-compete (#5) | `payment >= GD 10,000 AND payment <= GD 100,000` |
| Security Escort (#6) | `payment >= GD 15,000 AND payment <= GD 80,000` |

**Rejection message:** "Oferta rechazada por el regulador: precio fuera de rango permitido."

**Design rationale:** Template-only deals prevent free-form abuse, but without price floors a losing player can dump GD 2M in assets to a friend for GD 1. The 0.6x floor allows discounted sales (fire sale, urgent cash need) while preventing zero-value transfers. The 2.0x ceiling prevents money laundering (overpaying for a cheap property to transfer cash).

### 7.2.3 Bank Loan (Wired to InterestRates)

**Principal**: +GD 150,000 now (+GD 200,000 during Ventana Bancaria)

**Repayment** (scheduled for next INCOME):
```
Repay = Principal + 30,000 + (InterestRates × 15,000)
```
- `InterestRates` captured at loan time
- Record `scheduledRepayAmount` and `scheduledRepayRound`

| InterestRates | Repay (Normal) | Repay (Ventana) |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0 | GD 180,000 | GD 230,000 |
| 1 | GD 195,000 | GD 245,000 |
| 2 | GD 210,000 | GD 260,000 |
| 3 | GD 225,000 | GD 275,000 |

**Default**:
- If cannot pay: amount converts to Debt
- Fame -1 with headline "Deudor moroso"

### 7.2.6 Smart Deal Suggestions

Server generates pre-filled deal templates as contextual suggestions:

| Trigger Condition | Suggested Deal |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Another Owner has a property completing your district set | CASH_FOR_PROPERTY |
| Your cash < DevelopCost and you have upgradable properties | BANK_LOAN |
| 2+ Owners target same district repeatedly | NON_COMPETE |
| You own a Package and another Owner wants entry to that category | SELL_PACKAGE |

- Appear as one-tap "Oferta sugerida" cards in Deal Tray
- Player can modify amounts before sending
- Server generates max 2 suggestions per round per Owner

### 7.2.4 Deal Tray UI (v10 Fix)

**CRITICAL**: Never use blocking modals for deals.

**Implementation**:
1. Incoming deals appear in **Deal Tray** (sidebar/toast)
2. Non-blocking: player can continue other actions
3. Tray shows pending deals with Accept/Reject buttons

### 7.2.5 Busy Mode ("Modo Ocupado")

**Toggle**: Player can enable "Modo Ocupado"

**Effect**: Server auto-rejects all incoming deals immediately

**Feedback to sender**: "El jugador está ocupado (Auto-reject)"

**UI Label**: "Modo Concentrado"

## 7.3 Betrayal Mechanic: Romper Pacto

**Eligibility**: Owner has an active Non-compete pact

**Cost**: Once per match

**Effect**:
- Cancel pact immediately
- Fame +1 now
- RiskScore +1.0 next round
- Triggers trophy: `A-BET-01 "Rompiste el Pacto"`

## 7.4 Insurance (Minor Action — Property-Level)

| Upgrade Path | Cost (GD) |
|--------------|-----------|
| None → Basic | 20,000 |
| Basic → Full | 40,000 |
| None → Full | 60,000 |

Mitigation effects defined in Appendix B4.

## 7.5 Security Contract (Minor Action — Owner-Level)

**Cost**: GD 20,000
**Duration**: Until end of next round

**Mitigation**:
- Extortion cash effect reduced by GD 50,000
- Blocks Fame loss from extortion cards

## 7.6 PR / Compliance Actions (Minor)

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| PR Push | Fame +1 now; RiskScore +0.5 next round |
| Compliance Audit | Compliance +1 (max 3); RiskScore -0.5 next round |

## 7.7 Fame Spend Options (Once Per Round)

| Option | Cost | Effect | Limit |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| Yape de emergencia | 2 Fame | +GD 60,000 cash | Once per match |
| Control de daños | 2 Fame | Reduce event cash penalty by GD 50,000 | Per event |
| Cortina de humo | 3 Fame | Cancel one Fame loss | Per event |

## 7.8 Error Messages (Spanish)

If action requires cash you don't have:
> **"No te alcanza, causa."**

## 7.9 Property Packaging ("Paquete Inmobiliario")

### 7.9.1 Concept

Group 3+ property cards under a management umbrella to create a consolidated portfolio competitive with expensive individual properties. This is **player-level** packaging (grouping cards for synergy), distinct from the **card-level** portfolio framing (entry cards like "Portafolio 5 Depas" already represent bundled units thematically).

### 7.9.2 Requirements

**Action type:** Major action `PACKAGE` during ACTION phase.

**Conditions:**
- Own 3+ properties sharing a `packageCategory`:
  - `RESIDENTIAL_BUNDLE`: 3+ properties with `residencial` tag
  - `LOGISTICS_HUB`: 3+ properties with `logistica` tag
  - `COMMERCIAL_STRIP`: 3+ properties with `oficinas` or `cultura` tag
- No property already in another package
- Cost: GD 40,000

### 7.9.3 Effects

| Effect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Rent bonus per property in package | +GD 6,000 |
| Wealth bonus (package worth) | +GD 75,000 |
| OpsCost efficiency | Properties count as `ceil(count/2)` toward NumProperties |
| Unlocks | Deal template #7: SELL_PACKAGE |

### 7.9.4 Dissolution

- Selling or losing any property in the package dissolves it immediately
- Cannot reform a package for **2 rounds** after dissolution

### 7.9.5 Strategic Analysis

**"Many cheap" with packaging:**
3 entry properties: P-01 (200K) + P-03 (250K) + P-04 (280K) = GD 730K + 40K fee = GD 770K total.
Rent: (30K + 35K + 38K) + 18K synergy = GD 121,000/round. OpsCost: 0.

**"One premium" strategy:**
P-13 Edificio Surquillo: GD 750K. Rent: 75,000/round. OpsCost: 0.

Package generates 61% more rent but exposes 3 properties to events (higher RiskScore). Higher reward, higher variance.

### 7.9.6 TypeScript Interface

```typescript
interface PropertyPackage {
  packageId: Id;
  ownerId: Id;
  category: "RESIDENTIAL_BUNDLE" | "LOGISTICS_HUB" | "COMMERCIAL_STRIP";
  propertyIds: Id[];
  createdRound: number;
  rentBonusPerProperty: number;  // 6,000
  worthBonus: number;            // 75,000
  dissolvedRound?: number;       // if dissolved, when
}
```

# PART 8: TARGETED EVENT SYSTEM

## 8.1 RiskScore Formula (Explicit)

```
RiskScore =
    1.0
  + 0.35 × NumProperties
  + 0.20 × FameTier
  + 0.20 × WealthTier
  + 0.25 × PoliticalExposure
  - 0.25 × Compliance
  + DistrictRiskBonus
  + AttentionBonus
  - ProtectionBonus
  - RecentTargetShield
  + RumorBonus
```

**Clamp**: [0.5, 3.5]

### 8.1.1 Bonus Breakdown

| Bonus | Condition | Value |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| DistrictRiskBonus | Owns logistica-tag property | +0.2 |
| DistrictRiskBonus | Owns Centro/gobierno-tag | +0.1 |
| DistrictRiskBonus | Many costa-tag properties | +0.1 |
| AttentionBonus | PR Push last round | +0.2 |
| ProtectionBonus | Security Contract active | -0.2 |
| RecentTargetShield | Targeted last round | -0.6 |
| RumorBonus | Watcher rumors (capped) | +0.0 to +0.6 |

### 8.1.2 Tier Calculation

```
FameTier = floor(Fame / 3)  // 0-3
WealthTier = floor(Wealth / 500,000)  // 0-3 typical (GD scale)
```

## 8.2 Event Category Weights

| Category | Base Weight |
|----------|-------------|
| Seguridad | 25% |
| Licencias | 25% |
| Prensa | 25% |
| Incidentes | 20% |
| Global | 5% |

Special rounds can shift weights:
- Ventana Bancaria: Prensa +10%

## 8.3 Fairness Caps (Must Enforce)

| Cap | Rule |
|-----|------|
| FairnessCap | Max GD 150,000 cash damage per Owner per round; overflow becomes rent penalty |
| Expropriation | Max 1 per Owner per match |
| Global shocks | Mode cap; never >1 per 3 rounds |
| Double-target | No same Owner targeted twice in one round |
| Mercy rule | 0 properties → cannot be hit by property-loss events |
| HardHitSpacing | Max 1 event with cash loss ≥ GD 100,000 per 2-round window |
| Scandal bias | ≥60% of Prensa events are Fame-heavy (cash ≤ GD 50,000) |

## 8.4 Event Resolution (Player Choice with Timeout)

When an event offers a choice (pay cash to avoid penalty vs. accept penalty):

### 8.4.1 Choice Window

```
1. Server presents event with options to targeted Owner
2. Owner has 10 seconds to choose
3. If Owner chooses within 10s: apply chosen option
4. If timeout (no response): apply AutoChoice fallback
```

### 8.4.2 AutoChoice Fallback (Timeout Only)

```
if choice.payCash <= player.cash:
    if choice.payCash <= choice.penaltyValue:
        take "pay" option
    else:
        take "penalty" option
else:
    take "penalty" option
```

### 8.4.3 Pre-Match Preference (Optional Override)

Players can set a default preference before the match:
- "Siempre pagar para evitar penalidades" (Always pay to avoid penalties)
- "Siempre aceptar la penalidad" (Always accept penalty)
- "Decidir en el momento" (Decide in real-time) — **default**

If preference is set to "always pay" or "always accept," the server auto-resolves without the 10s window. Player can change preference between rounds via settings.

### 8.4.4 Design Rationale

Events are one of the game's most dramatic moments — a share-worthy "will they pay?" beat. Auto-resolving by default kills both tension and shareability. The 10s window is short enough to maintain game pace while giving players agency over their most impactful financial decisions. Players who prefer speed can opt into auto-resolve via pre-match preference.

**Phase timing:** The EVENTS phase timer accommodates the 10s choice window. If multiple events resolve in one round (rare, global + targeted), choices are sequential with 10s each.

## 8.5 Infrastructure Modifiers & Expropriation

### 8.5.1 Infrastructure Modifiers

| ID | Name | Duration |
|----|------|----------|
| INF-01 | Terminal del Metro anunciado | 2 rounds |
| INF-02 | Nueva vía expresa | 2 rounds |

**While INF active on district**:
- `enablesExpropriation = true`
- Rent +GD 5,000 for properties in district
- Worth +GD 100,000 for properties in district
- MapView shows animated corridor ("METRO" / "VIA")

### 8.5.2 E-053 "Anuncio de obras"

**Type**: GLOBAL_TARGET
**Logic**: ACTIVATE_INFRA

**District selection bias**:
- 50% choose among districts in current Market Row
- 50% choose among districts with most owned properties

**Effect**: Activates INF-01 or INF-02 on chosen district for 2 rounds

### 8.5.3 E-051 "Expropiación Municipal"

**Type**: TARGETED
**Condition**: DISTRICT_HAS_INFRA

**Resolution rule (no "no-op")**:
1. If ≥1 district has `enablesExpropriation=true`:
   - Target Owner who owns property in enabled district
   - One reroll of target owner if needed
2. If no enabled districts:
   - Resolve fallback **E-051B "Aviso de derecho de vía"**

### 8.5.4 E-051B "Aviso de derecho de vía" (Fallback)

**Effects**:
- Cash -GD 50,000
- `tradeLockedUntilRound = currentRound + 2` on random owned property

**Headline theme**: Blueprint/"trazo"

```

### 11.5.2 Scale-Up Path
- Redis for session sharing
- S3 for share assets
- Multiple Colyseus processes with matchmaker

---

# PART 12: SECURITY & ANTI-ABUSE

## 12.1 Phase Gating

Server enforces strict phase transitions:
- Actions only accepted during correct phase
- Invalid phase actions rejected with error

## 12.2 Validation Rules

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Bid validation | Amount ≤ player cash |
| Action validation | Player has required resources |
| Deal validation | Both parties have assets |
| Property ownership | Verified before any transfer |

## 12.3 JIT Round Seed (v10 Security Fix)

**Problem**: Pre-shared seeds allow RNG prediction

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Server-side only
const serverSecret = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');

function generateRoundSeed(matchSeed: string, roundNumber: number): string {
  return sha256(`${matchSeed}|${serverSecret}|${roundNumber}`);
}
```

**Rule**: `serverSecret` NEVER sent to client

## 12.4 Rate Limiting

| Action | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Bid submission | 1 per round |
| Deal offer | 1 per round |
| Mood vote | 1 per round |
| Rumor | 1 per match |
| Reconnect attempts | 5 per minute |

## 12.5 Idempotency

- All client messages include `idempotencyKey` (UUID)
- Server rejects duplicate keys
- Monotonic nonce per session

## 12.6 Reconnection Handling

### 12.6.1 Disconnect Timeline

| Time Since Disconnect | Behavior |
|-----------------------|----------|
| 0-10s | Grace period. Player's actions timeout normally (no bid = no bid, no action = Pass). No bot activation. |
| 10s-60s | **Bot activates.** Bot heuristics (A8) take over all decisions. Match continues normally. Player slot reserved. |
| 60s-5min | Bot continues. Reconnection still allowed. Player receives push notification: "Tu partida continua. Reconecta ahora." |
| >5min | Bot continues permanently. Player can rejoin at any point during the remaining match. Seat is never locked. |

### 12.6.2 Reconnection Protocol

When a disconnected player reconnects:

```
1. Client sends RECONNECT { sessionId, matchId }
2. Server validates session
3. Server sends STATE_SNAPSHOT (full current state)
4. Client rebuilds UI from snapshot
5. Server deactivates bot, returns control to player
6. If current phase has active timer: player joins mid-phase with remaining time
7. If current phase has already collected this player's input (bot acted):
   player resumes at NEXT phase
```

**Queued actions:** Any actions the client queued during disconnect are discarded. The bot's decisions during disconnect are final and cannot be reversed.

### 12.6.3 Push Notifications (Phase 2)

| Event | Notification |
|-------|-------------|
| Disconnect during active match | "Tu partida sigue. Reconecta: imperio.game/rejoin/{matchId}" (after 30s) |
| Match about to end (last round) | "Ultima ronda! Vuelve ahora." |
| Dynasty member online | "Tu compañero {name} esta jugando." (if opted in) |

### 12.6.4 Rate Limiting

Max 5 reconnection attempts per minute per player. Exceeding this triggers a 60s cooldown before next attempt.

# PART 13: GRAF DOLLAR METAGAME ECONOMY

## 13.1 Currency Model — Prestige Leaderboard

**Core principle:** Graf Dollar (GD) is a **prestige currency for lifetime wealth ranking**. It does NOT grant in-match advantage. Matches are always fair — everyone starts equal.

> **Currency Note (v12.3):** Graf Dollar (GD) is the ONLY progression currency. There is no separate "Dynasty XP" or experience point system. All rewards, rankings, challenge payouts, and progression use GD exclusively. This simplifies the economy and prevents confusion between multiple currency types.

| Layer | How It Works |
|-------|-------------|
| **In-match** | All players start with identical GD (500K/650K/800K by mode). Match plays normally. At match end, final Wealth is calculated. |
| **Persistent Wallet** | Match outcomes ADD GD to your lifetime balance. Tracked in PostgreSQL double-entry ledger per `graf_dollar.txt`. |
| **Leaderboard** | Ranked by accumulated lifetime GD. Players display any custom name they choose. Dynasty name shown alongside. |

**What GD is for:**
- Lifetime wealth leaderboard ranking (primary prestige driver)
- Display name + dynasty branding on the public ladder
- Optional cosmetic unlocks (badges, crests, titles)
- Player-to-player transfers/loans (Phase 2/3 per graf_dollar.txt)

**What GD is NOT for:**
- Buying in-match advantages
- Starting with more cash than other players
- Unlocking stronger properties or actions
- Any pay-to-win mechanic

## 13.2 Match-to-Wallet Flow

At match end, each player's final in-match Wealth is converted to persistent GD and credited to their wallet via the ledger system.

| Outcome | Persistent GD Earned |
|---------|---------------------|
| Final Wealth (always) | Your end-of-match Wealth added to wallet |
| 1st place bonus | +GD 200,000 |
| 2nd place bonus | +GD 100,000 |
| 3rd place bonus | +GD 50,000 |
| Achievement unlock | +GD 20,000-100,000 depending on rarity |

**Design rationale:** Awarding actual final Wealth (not just flat bonuses) means every in-match decision matters for the leaderboard. A 1st-place finish with GD 3M Wealth earns massively more than a 1st-place with GD 1M. This incentivizes aggressive, high-Wealth play.

**Ledger Architecture:** Uses `ledger_tx` + `ledger_entry` double-entry system from `graf_dollar.txt`. Match rewards are `tx_type='award'` with `idempotency_key='award:{match_id}:{user_id}:wealth'`. System account mints all GD.

**New player welcome:** GD 0 starting balance. No GD needed to play.

## 13.3 Leaderboard System

### 13.3.1 Tiered Leagues

| League | GD Threshold | Badge Color |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Inquilino (Tenant) | 0 - 999,999 | Gray |
| Propietario (Owner) | 1,000,000 - 9,999,999 | Bronze |
| Inversionista (Investor) | 10,000,000 - 49,999,999 | Silver |
| Magnate | 50,000,000 - 199,999,999 | Gold |
| Emperador (Emperor) | 200,000,000+ | Diamond |

**Threshold rationale:** Average Quick Mode final Wealth ~ GD 800K-1.5M. Winner ~ GD 2-3M. Propietario requires ~1-5 matches. Inversionista ~10-30. Magnate ~50-100. Emperador ~150+ matches of strong play.

### 13.3.2 Seasonal Decay

- Monthly soft reset: all balances above GD 5,000,000 decay by 10%
- Forces active play to maintain ranking
- Season rewards: top 100 get exclusive cosmetic badge

### 13.3.3 Contextual Views

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Friends | Compare against your circle |
| Regional | Lima districts — ties into game theme |
| Dynasty | Aggregate GD of all players in same dynasty |
| All-time | Permanent hall of fame |

### 13.3.4 Social Display

GD balance and league badge shown on:
- Profile card
- Portada share cards (end-of-match)
- Lobby player list
- Quick Chat name tag

**Virality angle:** The Dynasty leaderboard is the strongest viral hook — players recruit friends into their dynasty to climb the collective rankings. This aligns with the referral system (Section 3.5.4).

## 13.4 Cosmetic Spending (Never Gameplay Advantage)

| Phase | Available Spending |
|-------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 (MVP) | Profile badges, team crests, custom titles |
| Phase 2 | Player-to-player GD transfers (gifting, alliance signaling) |
| Phase 3 | Player-to-player GD loans (social contracts) |

## 13.5 Database Integration

### 13.5.1 New/Updated Tables

| Table | Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `ledger_tx` | graf_dollar.txt §4.1.1 | Transaction header (award, transfer, purchase, etc.) |
| `ledger_entry` | graf_dollar.txt §4.1.2 | Double-entry lines (sum = 0 per tx) |
| `balance_cache` | graf_dollar.txt §4.1.3 | Derived balance for performance |
| `loan_contract` | graf_dollar.txt §4.1.4 | Phase 3 player loans |

### 13.5.2 Idempotency Keys

| Operation | Key Format |
|-----------|-----------|
| Match wealth award | `award:{match_id}:{user_id}:wealth` |
| Placement bonus | `award:{match_id}:{user_id}:placement:{rank}` |
| Achievement bonus | `award:{match_id}:{user_id}:achievement:{achievement_id}` |
| Transfer | `xfer:{sender_id}:{client_request_id}` |
| Cosmetic purchase | `buy:{user_id}:{order_id}` |

# PART 14: MATCHMAKING & ROOM DISCOVERY (NEW in v12.1)

## 14.1 Room Discovery

### 14.1.1 Lobby Browser (PUBLIC Rooms)

Players see a filterable list of available PUBLIC rooms:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| Mode | Quick / Standard / Long |
| Status | Waiting / In Progress (spectate only) |
| Players | Show current/max (e.g., "4/12") |
| Sort | Newest first (default), Most players, Starting soon |

**Refresh:** Auto-refresh every 5s. Manual pull-to-refresh on mobile.

**Create Room:** One-tap "Crear Partida" button with mode selection (Quick default).

### 14.1.2 Quick Play (Auto-Match)

"Jugar Ya" button — auto-joins the best available room:

```
1. Filter rooms by selected mode (Quick default)
2. Prefer rooms with 3+ players (close to starting)
3. If no suitable room exists, create a new one
4. Player enters LOBBY state immediately
```

### 14.1.3 Friends Room (Private)

```
1. Host taps "Crear Sala Privada" → selects mode
2. Server generates 5-character alphanumeric room code (e.g., LIMA7)
3. Host shares via:
   - One-tap "Compartir" → WhatsApp (primary LATAM), Telegram, Copy Link
   - Share message: "Juega Imperio Inmobiliario conmigo! Código: {CODE} — imperio.game/join/{CODE}"
   - QR code display (for in-person invites)
4. Friends join via:
   - Deep link: opens app/web client directly into room
   - Manual: "Unirse con Código" input field in lobby
```

## 14.2 Match Start Rules

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Minimum players to start | 4 Owners |
| Maximum Owners | 12 (Standard), 8 (Quick), 12 (Long) |
| Maximum participants | 20 (Owners + Watchers) |
| Host start | Host can start manually when ≥ 4 Owners |
| Auto-start | 30s countdown when room reaches max Owners |
| Bot fill (PUBLIC) | If < 4 Owners after 120s in LOBBY, fill remaining with bots up to 6 total |
| Bot fill (FRIENDS) | Host-controlled: toggle "Rellenar con bots" (default OFF) |
| Late join | Allowed during Round 1 only (fill empty seats) |

## 14.3 Matchmaking Tiers (Phase 2 — Ranked Mode)

Ranked mode unlocks at Propietario league (GD 1,000,000+).

```
filterBy:
  mode: selected_mode
  eloRange: floor(player_elo / 200) * 200

searchExpansion:
  0-10s:  exact eloRange match
  10-20s: ±1 eloRange band (±200 ELO)
  20-30s: ±2 eloRange bands (±400 ELO)
  30s+:   any rank, start with bots if needed
```

**ELO Calculation:**
- Starting ELO: 1000
- Win: +25 × (1 - expected_score)
- Loss: -25 × expected_score
- expected_score = 1 / (1 + 10^((opponent_avg_elo - player_elo) / 400))
- Use average opponent ELO for multiplayer calculation

## 14.4 Deep Link Architecture

| Purpose | URL Pattern | Behavior |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Room invite | `imperio.game/join/{roomCode}` | Opens client, joins room directly |
| Referral | `imperio.game/ref/{userId}` | Opens client, registers referrer, starts onboarding |
| Rematch | `imperio.game/play/{matchId}` | Opens client, creates room with same mode/players invited |
| Dynasty | `imperio.game/dynasty/{dynastyId}` | Opens client, shows dynasty page with join option |
| Spectate | `imperio.game/watch/{roomId}` | Opens client as Watcher in active match |

**Non-player flow:**
1. Link opens web client (no install required for WASM build)
2. If no account: spectate first match anonymously
3. After match ends: CTA "Crea tu cuenta y juega" with one-tap signup
4. Account creation pre-fills referrer if deep link included `ref/` parameter

## A2: Deal Engine Rules (Deterministic)

### Lifecycle
1. Each Owner can have at most 1 outgoing offer per round
2. Offer expires at end of DEALS phase of same round
3. One counter-offer maximum

### Resolution Order (DEALS Phase)
1. Expire stale offers
2. Resolve ACCEPTED deals deterministically (sorted by `dealId`)
3. If referenced property not owned by sender → deal becomes INVALID

### Conflict Rules
- A property may be transferred at most once per round via deals
- If two accepted deals transfer same property:
  - Lowest `dealId` resolves
  - Others become INVALID

### Forced Sales
- Occur during INCOME
- Can invalidate later deals

## A7: Property Deck

See `data/properties.json` for authoritative source.

### Deck Rules
- Finite list
- Market Row draws without replacement
- When deck ends: reshuffle discard with deterministic shuffle using `matchSeed`

### Property Schema
```typescript
interface Property {
  id: string;           // "P-01"
  nombre_es: string;    // "Portafolio Depas Los Olivos"
  district: string;     // "Independencia/Los Olivos"
  tags: string[];       // ["residencial"]
  basePrice: number;    // 200000 (GD)
  baseRent: number;     // 30000 (GD)
  upgradeSlotsMax: 0 | 1 | 2;
  buildQuality: "STANDARD" | "PREMIUM";
  packageCategory?: "RESIDENTIAL_BUNDLE" | "LOGISTICS_HUB" | "COMMERCIAL_STRIP";
}
```

**Property card concept:** Each card represents a **real estate operation**, not necessarily a single unit. Lower-end cards represent bundled portfolios of smaller assets (e.g., "Portafolio 5 Depas Los Olivos" = five apartments packaged as one investment card). Higher-end cards represent individual trophy assets (e.g., "Torre Financiera" = one floor of a premium office tower). All cards work identically in-game.

### Expanded Property Deck (25 Properties)

**Tier structure:** Entry (200K-400K, ~13-15% yield, 7 properties), Mid (450K-750K, ~10-12% yield, 6 properties), Upper (800K-1.3M, ~8-10% yield, 7 properties), Premium (1.5M-2M, ~6.5-7.5% yield, 5 properties).

| P-25 | Torre Financiera San Isidro | San Isidro | oficinas, gobierno, premium_area | 2,000,000 | 130,000 | 2 |

**Tag distribution:** residencial (15), logistica (5), cultura (5), oficinas (3), costa (7), turismo (3), gobierno (4), premium_area (6), zona_caliente (2).

**District set bonus opportunities (2+ in same district):** Independencia/Los Olivos (2), Ate/SJL (2), Chorrillos (2), Barranco (3), Callao (2), Surco (2), La Molina (2), Miraflores (2), San Isidro (3).

**Deck sizing:** 25 properties / 5 per Market Row = 5 rounds without reshuffling (covers Quick Mode).

## A8: Bot Heuristics (NEW in v10)

**Role**: Fill empty seats in Tutorial/Public matches; handle disconnects.

### H1: Economy Safety
```typescript
function shouldPass(bot: OwnerState): boolean {
  return bot.cash < 100_000;  // GD 100K reserve
}

function maxBid(bot: OwnerState): number {
  return Math.max(0, bot.cash - 100_000);  // Keep GD 100K reserve
}
```

### H2: Bidding Logic
```typescript
function calculateBid(bot: OwnerState, property: PropertyState): number {
  const valuation = property.basePrice + (property.baseRent * 2);
  const maxAffordable = bot.cash - 100_000;  // Keep GD 100K reserve (standardized)
  return Math.min(valuation, maxAffordable);
}

// Tutorial Override
function tutorialBid(round: number): number {
  if (round === 1) return 50_000;  // Always lose to human (bid below cheapest property)
  return calculateBid(this, property);
}
```

### H3: Deal Logic
- **Incoming**: Always REJECT (reduces complexity)
- **Outgoing**: Never initiate

### H4: Event Choices
```typescript
function handleEventChoice(cost: number, penalty: number): string {
  if (this.cash >= cost) return "PAY";
  return "PENALTY";
}
```

### H5: Action Selection
```typescript
function selectAction(bot: OwnerState): { major: string; minor?: string } {
  if (bot.cash < 100_000) return { major: "PASS" };

  // Major: Develop if affordable
  const developCost = getDevelopCost();  // GD 60K-100K
  let major = "PASS";
  if (bot.cash >= developCost && bot.properties.length > 0) {
    major = "DEVELOP";
  }

  // Minor: Insure if we have uninsured properties and enough cash
  let minor: string | undefined;
  const hasUninsured = bot.properties.some(p => getProperty(p).insurance === "NONE");
  if (hasUninsured && bot.cash >= developCost + 20_000) {
    minor = "INSURE";
  }

  return { major, minor };
}
```

### H6: Mood/Vote Logic (NEW in v12.1)

```typescript
function decideMoodVote(bot: OwnerState, options: MoodOption[]): string {
  // Prefer the positive/beneficial option
  const positive = options.find(o => o.sentiment === "positive");
  if (positive) return positive.id;
  // Fallback: pick the option that affects the most properties the bot doesn't own
  return options[0].id;
}

function decideElectionVote(bot: OwnerState, candidates: Candidate[]): string {
  // Vote for the candidate whose bonus helps bot's tag portfolio
  const tagCounts = countBotPropertyTags(bot);
  return candidates.reduce((best, c) =>
    (tagCounts[c.bonusTag] || 0) > (tagCounts[best.bonusTag] || 0) ? c : best
  ).id;
}
```

### H7: Package Logic (NEW in v12.1)

```typescript
function shouldCreatePackage(bot: OwnerState): PropertyPackage | null {
  if (bot.cash < 40_000) return null;

  // Check each package category
  for (const category of ["RESIDENTIAL_BUNDLE", "LOGISTICS_HUB", "COMMERCIAL_STRIP"]) {
    const eligible = getEligibleProperties(bot, category);
    if (eligible.length >= 3) {
      return { category, propertyIds: eligible.slice(0, 3) };
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

### H8: Fame Spend Logic (NEW in v12.1)

```typescript
function decideFameSpend(bot: OwnerState, event: EventResult): FameSpendUsed | null {
  // Control de danos: spend 2 Fame to halve cash loss if loss >= 100K
  if (event.cashLoss >= 100_000 && bot.fame >= 2) {
    return "CONTROL_DE_DANOS";
  }
  // Cortina de humo: spend 3 Fame to cancel Fame loss if loss >= 2
  if (event.fameLoss >= 2 && bot.fame >= 3) {
    return "CORTINA_DE_HUMO";
  }
  return null;
}
```

### H9: Deal Evaluation (NEW in v12.1)

```typescript
function evaluateDeal(bot: OwnerState, deal: DealOffer): "ACCEPT" | "REJECT" {
  switch (deal.template) {
    case "CASH_FOR_PROPERTY":
      // Accept if offered >= 1.1x BasePrice (good deal)
      const property = getProperty(deal.propertyId);
      return deal.amount >= property.basePrice * 1.1 ? "ACCEPT" : "REJECT";

    case "BANK_LOAN":
      // Accept if cash < 80K and no active loan
      return bot.cash < 80_000 && !bot.hasActiveLoan ? "ACCEPT" : "REJECT";

    default:
      return "REJECT";  // Conservative on complex deals
  }
}
```

### H-RESERVE: Standardized Reserve (FIX in v12.1)

All bot heuristics use a unified GD 100,000 reserve:

```typescript
const BOT_CASH_RESERVE = 100_000;

// H1 shouldPass: bot.cash < BOT_CASH_RESERVE
// H1 maxBid: bot.cash - BOT_CASH_RESERVE
// H2 calculateBid: Math.min(valuation, bot.cash - BOT_CASH_RESERVE)
// H5 selectAction: bot.cash < BOT_CASH_RESERVE → PASS
```

The previous inconsistency between GD 100K (H1) and GD 50K (H2) is resolved. All functions use `BOT_CASH_RESERVE`.

## V6.1: Dynamic Audio Layers (NEW in v12.3)

Audio should respond to game state, not just play static tracks. This creates emotional peaks at key moments.

### Phase-Based Ambient Layers

| Phase | Base Track | Layer | Intensity |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| LOBBY | music_menu | None | Low |
| REVEAL | music_match | market_ambient | Low |
| BID | music_match | auction_tension | Escalating |
| INCOME_CALC | music_match | None (brief) | Low |
| VISUAL_LEDGER | music_match | ledger_shuffle | Medium |
| ACTION | music_match | thinking_ambient | Low |
| MOOD | music_match | crowd_murmur | Medium |
| VOTE | music_match | political_ambient | Medium |
| DEALS | music_match | negotiation_ambient | Low |
| EVENTS | music_match | suspense_build | Escalating |
| PRESS | music_match | newsroom_ambient | Medium |
| AWARDS | music_victory | celebration_layer | High |

### Tension Escalation System

**BID Phase Escalation**:
```
Timer > 15s remaining: Normal tempo
Timer 10-15s: +10% tempo, add subtle bass pulse
Timer 5-10s: +20% tempo, heartbeat layer fades in
Timer < 5s: Heartbeat dominant, high-pass filter on music
Timer = 0: Gavel SFX cuts all layers
```

**EVENTS Phase Escalation**:
```
Event card revealed: Suspense sting
Target selection animation: Drum roll layer
Target revealed (self): Impact sting + bass drop
Target revealed (other): Relief sigh SFX
```

### Audio Layer Assets (6 NEW)

| ID | Layer | Description |
|----|-------|-------------|
| layer_auction_tension | BID | Ticking clock, rising strings |
| layer_heartbeat | BID (final 5s) | Rhythmic heartbeat, 90 BPM |
| layer_suspense_build | EVENTS | Low drone, intermittent stings |
| layer_crowd_murmur | MOOD/VOTE | Crowd ambience, occasional cheer |
| layer_negotiation | DEALS | Paper shuffle, pen scratches |
| layer_celebration | AWARDS | Crowd cheering, confetti rustle |

### Implementation Notes

- All layers should be separate audio files that crossfade
- Use AudioStreamPlayer with bus routing for layer mixing
- Tempo changes via AudioServer pitch_scale (not re-sampling)
- Heartbeat layer: Pre-rendered at 90 BPM, loop seamlessly
- Target: 3-5 simultaneous layers max for mobile performance

### Volume Ducking Rules

| Event | Duck Target | Amount | Duration |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| SFX plays | Music | -6dB | 0.3s + SFX length |
| Voice stinger | Music + SFX | -9dB | Stinger length |
| Phase transition | All layers | -3dB | 0.5s fade |
| Tension peak | Ambient layers | -12dB | Until resolution |

## G4: Batch Generation Workflows — Updated

### G4.1 Midjourney Batch Workflow

```
1. PREPARATION
   - Create prompt spreadsheet with all variations
   - Set up Discord server with Midjourney bot
   - Prepare naming convention: {ASSET_TYPE}_{ID}_{VERSION}

2. GENERATION
   - Use /imagine with template prompt
   - Generate 4 variations per prompt
   - Select best variation with V1-V4 buttons
   - Upscale selected with U1-U4

3. ORGANIZATION
   - Download all upscaled images
   - Rename following convention
   - Sort into asset type folders

4. POST-PROCESSING
   - Remove backgrounds (remove.bg or Photoshop)
   - Resize to target dimensions
   - Apply consistent color correction
   - Export final formats (PNG, SVG trace)
```

### G4.2 DALL-E 3 API Batch Script

```python
# scripts/generate_assets.py
import openai
from pathlib import Path
import json

client = openai.OpenAI()

def generate_asset(prompt: str, size: str = "1024x1024") -> str:
    """Generate single asset and return URL."""
    response = client.images.generate(
        model="dall-e-3",
        prompt=prompt,
        size=size,
        quality="hd",
        n=1
    )
    return response.data[0].url

def batch_generate(prompts_file: str, output_dir: str):
    """Batch generate assets from prompt file."""
    output_path = Path(output_dir)
    output_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    with open(prompts_file) as f:
        prompts = json.load(f)

    for item in prompts:
        print(f"Generating: {item['id']}")
        url = generate_asset(item['prompt'], item.get('size', '1024x1024'))

        # Download and save
        import requests
        response = requests.get(url)
        filename = f"{item['id']}.png"
        (output_path / filename).write_bytes(response.content)
        print(f"Saved: {filename}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    batch_generate("prompts/stickers.json", "output/stickers")
```

### G4.3 Prompt File Format

```json
// prompts/mascot_poses.json
[
  {
    "id": "MAGNATE_STANDING",
    "prompt": "Distinguished elderly businessman character, 70 years old, white silver hair swept back elegantly, warm confident smile, holding thick Cuban cigar with visible smoke wisps, wearing perfectly tailored navy blue suit, white dress shirt, teal turquoise silk tie and pocket square, gold Rolex watch, caricature portrait style like premium mobile tycoon game mascot, NOT based on any real person, standing confidently with one hand on lapel, transparent background, semi-realistic digital painting --ar 2:3",
    "size": "1024x1536"
  },
  {
    "id": "MAGNATE_THUMBSUP",
    "prompt": "Distinguished elderly businessman character, 70 years old, white silver hair, warm smile, Cuban cigar in one hand, giving enthusiastic thumbs up with other hand, navy blue suit, teal tie, gold watch, mobile tycoon game mascot style, NOT based on real person, transparent background --ar 1:1",
    "size": "1024x1024"
  }
]
```

```json
// prompts/district_backdrops.json
[
  {
    "id": "BACKDROP_MIRAFLORES",
    "prompt": "Aerial view of Miraflores district Lima Peru, Costa Verde cliffs, Pacific Ocean, modern glass skyscrapers, Larcomar mall, golden hour lighting, semi-realistic digital painting, mobile tycoon game background, aspirational aesthetic, no text --ar 16:9",
    "size": "1792x1024"
  },
  {
    "id": "BACKDROP_SANISIDRO",
    "prompt": "Aerial view of San Isidro financial district Lima Peru, glass skyscrapers, El Olivar park olive trees, corporate towers, golden hour lighting, semi-realistic digital painting, mobile tycoon game background --ar 16:9",
    "size": "1792x1024"
  }
]
```

## G5: Post-Processing Pipeline

### G5.1 Background Removal

**Services**:
- remove.bg (API available, best quality)
- Photoshop "Remove Background"
- GIMP with alpha selection

```bash
# Using remove.bg CLI
removebg --api-key YOUR_KEY input.png output.png
```

### G5.2 SVG Tracing (for icons/crests)

**Tools**:
- Adobe Illustrator Image Trace
- Inkscape Trace Bitmap
- Vector Magic (online)

**Settings for clean game icons**:
```
Mode: Color
Colors: 6-8 max
Paths: Smooth
Corners: Fewer
Noise: Ignore small details
```

### G5.3 Batch Resize Script

```python
# scripts/resize_assets.py
from PIL import Image
from pathlib import Path

SIZES = {
    "skyline": (1920, 1080),
    "avatar": (256, 256),
    "icon": (128, 128),
    "sticker": (256, 256),
    "badge": (128, 128),
}

def resize_batch(input_dir: str, asset_type: str):
    target_size = SIZES[asset_type]
    input_path = Path(input_dir)
    output_path = input_path / "resized"
    output_path.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

    for img_file in input_path.glob("*.png"):
        img = Image.open(img_file)
        img = img.resize(target_size, Image.LANCZOS)
        img.save(output_path / img_file.name)
        print(f"Resized: {img_file.name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    resize_batch("assets/stickers", "sticker")
```
